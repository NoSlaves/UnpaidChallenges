# UnpaidChallenges
Challenges from companies who are trying to get free work, BEWARE!!!!

# HotelTonight
You can get this challenge correct and they will not hire you. It appears that they are only interested in wasting your time and taking your ideas!!! They have over 80M in funding but they don't want to pay for challenges. Somebody call the Department of Labor!!!

# Doximity
These guys and one girl are completely full of it!!! It does not matter if you get this right. Also, check the list of PR's to the project and you'll see all the other victims, which shows you how sloppy they are. Run from these liars and thieves!!!

# HeadSpin.io
These guys are a total joke!!! They have 4 people and like to take resumes and challenges to claim they can't find workers.
